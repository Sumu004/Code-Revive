# Code-Revive

Code Revive is an innovative application that enables developers to convert codebases between different programming languages seamlessly. Powered by the LLAMA 3 model, this app utilizes the GROQ API and is built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive user interface for efficient code translation.

## Features

- **Language Conversion**: Convert code snippets or entire codebases from one programming language to another with high accuracy.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for real-time code input and output display.
- **GROQ API Integration**: Leverage the GROQ API for efficient querying and data manipulation to optimize the conversion process.
- **Documentation and Support**: Documentation on the Code Base.

## Technologies Used

- **LLAMA 3**: A state-of-the-art language model for advanced language processing.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for building interactive web applications with ease.
- **GROQ API**: A powerful query language and API for efficient data handling.

## Installation

To set up Code Revive locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sumu004/Code-Revive.git
   cd Code-Revive
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate # On Linux use `source venv/bin/activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set your Groq API key**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Fill in `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env`.

5. **Run the Streamlit app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.
2. Upload your codebase as a zip file.
3. Select the target programming language from the sidebar.
4. Click "Analyze Codebase" to see the converted code, its test-case
   accuracy score, and generated technical documentation.
